Sailfish polkit Agent
=====================

This is the polkit[1] agent for Sailfish OS. It is split into two parts:

     +-----------------------+           +------------------------+
     | sailfish-polkit-agent |           | sailfish-polkit-daemon |
     |                       | --------> |                        |
     | in-session, user nemo |           | on demand, user root   |
     +-----------------------+           +------------------------+

The sailfish-polkit-agent is running in the post-user-session and will register
itself as authentication agent with the polkit authority. When a polkit
authorization request comes in, it will decide whether to grant or deny the
request automatically or (if a decision cannot be made automatically) show a
dialog to let the user choose whether or not to grant the request.

If the request is granted, the agent will send a D-Bus call with the cookie and
requested identity to sailfish-polkit-daemon on the System D-Bus. This is
required, as the polkit authority will only accept agent responses coming from
processes with uid=0. In order to prevent non-agent applications from faking a
response via D-Bus, sailfish-polkit-daemon checks if the requesting process is
in the "privileged" group (effective gid). The sailfish-polkit-daemon will then
wait for possible other requests, or just quit after a timeout (it will always
be D-Bus activated on demand when required).

TODO:

    add: /usr/bin/sailfish-polkit-agent,n
     to: /usr/share/mapplauncherd/privileges
